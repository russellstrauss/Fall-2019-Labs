# CS 7450 Labs

This repository is designed to help you learn the skills needed to create data visualizations on the web. Through this lab, you will learn how to program with the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) toolkit. D3 has become the go-to tool for creating interactive visualizations. D3 leverages existing web technologies in order to bring your interactive visualizations to a global audience via the Web.

[Lab Instructions can be found on this repository's Wiki](https://github.gatech.edu/CS-7450/Fall-2019-Labs/wiki)

### Reading Materials

The labs will generally follow Scott Murray's [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book-2e). In the *Prerequisites* section of each lab we will list the accompanying chapter or section of the Murray book.
